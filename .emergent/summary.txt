**original_problem_statement**: The initial problem statement from the previous fork focused on translating the entire application from hardcoded French to an internationalization (i18n) system with English as the default language, while also addressing a long list of critical bugs.

During this session, the user added several new requests:
1.  Add three new static pages: Legal (), Terms of Use (), and FAQ, with content scraped from the main website.
2.  Restore the notification bell feature, which was missing from the UI, and ensure it was functional.
3.  Fix a crash that occurred when playing a track from the .
4.  Fix a critical regression where purchased VIP tracks became locked again after re-logging in.
5.  Remove the Buy More button from the VIP page.
6.  Once all development was complete, provide guidance on how to perform the final application build for the app stores.

**User's preferred language**: Français (French). The next agent MUST respond in French.

**what currently exists?**
The application is in a stable, feature-complete state according to the user. All hardcoded French strings have been successfully migrated to the i18n system (), making the app fully bilingual with English as the default. All new user requests from this session have been implemented: the three new legal/FAQ pages were created and linked, the notification system was restored and fixed, the VIP purchase regression was resolved, and minor UI cleanup was performed. The user has been guided through the process of exporting the code and running An Expo user account is required to proceed.

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending or in-progress issues. The user has approved all work and considers the project finished. However, there is a high-risk recurring issue that should be monitored.

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: VIP Purchase Persistence Bug (P1 - High Risk of Recurrence)**
    -   **Description**: A bug where tracks purchased in the VIP zone become locked again after an app restart. This is a recurring issue that was fixed in a previous session and resurfaced in this one.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified that the  function in  was incorrectly using  (which points directly to the Base44 BaaS) for calls on mobile, instead of  (which points to the application's local backend proxy). The fix was to change the call to use , which correctly routes the request through the local server. The user confirmed this fixed the issue.
    -   **Next debug checklist**: If this bug recurs, immediately inspect . The root cause is almost always an incorrect API instance ( vs. ) being used for a specific platform (web vs. mobile). Ensure all calls to custom backend endpoints (prefixed with ) use .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is critical for the app's monetization and user experience.
    -   **Status**: RESOLVED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   P2: Investigate the Black Diamond data discrepancy. A user from a previous session reported sessions showing multiple diamonds awarded, contrary to the one per day rule. This was never investigated. The logic around the  field in the  entity and any server-side logic that grants it should be checked.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Full Application Translation**: Migrated all hardcoded French strings across ~20 files to the i18n system in , setting English as the default language.
-   **Notification System Restoration & Fix**:
    -   Made the notification bell icon visible in the  header.
    -   Fixed the  styling to display correctly as a bottom sheet on mobile.
    -   Ensured all 6 notification categories display correctly.
-   **New Content Pages**:
    -   Created , , and  in .
    -   Scraped content from the user's website to populate these pages.
    -   Added links to these pages in the user's profile screen ().
-   **VIP Zone Bug Fixes**:
    -   **Resolved Regression**: Fixed the critical bug where purchased VIP tracks would re-lock by correcting the API call in .
    -   **UI Cleanup**: Removed the Buy More button from the  page.
-   **Player Bug Fix**: Fixed a crash in  by adding a missing  hook import.
-   **Build Support**: Guided the user through the local An Expo user account is required to proceed.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Black Diamond data discrepancy**
    -   **Debug checklist**: A user from a previous session reported sessions showing multiple diamonds awarded, contrary to the one per day rule. This was never investigated. The agent should check the logic around the  field in the  entity and any server-side logic that grants it in  or .
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: Ensures the core reward mechanism of the app is functioning as designed.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: Both.
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: VIP Zone Purchase Persistence.
-   **Recurrence count**: 2 (Fixed in a previous fork, and fixed again in this session).
-   **Status**: RESOLVED. The agent fixed the root cause by correcting the API instance used in  for mobile calls. This is a critical point of failure to watch in the future.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**: The core task. The entire app was refactored to use a React Context () for bilingual (EN/FR) support.
-   **Platform-Specific API Routing**: The VIP bug was a classic example of this project's recurring issue: using the wrong API instance ( vs. ) for mobile, leading to requests hitting the wrong server.
-   **UI/UX Debugging**: Fixed the  which was a combination of state initialization and platform-specific styling issues. It was corrected to a bottom sheet style for a better mobile experience.
-   **Code Scraping**: Used web scraping to pull content from the user's live website to populate the new static pages.

**All files of reference**
-   : CRITICAL FILE. Central hub for all application text.
-   : CRITICAL FILE. Contains the fix for the recurring VIP bug.
-   : Contains the implementation and fix for the notification UI.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Langue de l'utilisateur**: La communication doit impérativement être en **français**.
-   **Project Status**: The user considers the development phase **complete**. They have exported the code and successfully run the final An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username. The next requests will likely be bug reports from their final testing or questions related to app store submission.
-   **High-Risk Regression**: The **VIP Purchase Persistence** bug has occurred twice. Any changes to  or VIP-related logic must be tested thoroughly on both web and mobile to prevent it from happening again. The key is ensuring calls to the local backend proxy use  and not another instance.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Healthy**: The application is stable, feature-complete according to the user, and all known critical bugs have been resolved.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Spynners / Base44**: Primary Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for data storage.
-   **Ngrok**: Used for the Expo Go tunnel for mobile testing.
-   **Expo Application Services (EAS)**: Used by the user locally for building the final app binaries.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: YES. The  was used and passed before the end of the session. The agent also used screenshot tools extensively to verify UI changes.
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: []
-   Known regressions: The VIP purchase persistence bug was a known regression that was identified and fixed during this session.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Email:** 
-   **Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The Black Diamond data discrepancy issue, which was noted as a future (P2) task in the initial summary, was not addressed. Given the user's desire to finalize and build the app, this was implicitly deprioritized. It remains an outstanding, low-priority technical debt item.
